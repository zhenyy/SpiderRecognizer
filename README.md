# Spider Recognition iOS App
This repository contains codes and scripts for our real-time spider recognition app: a mobile deep learning application that recognises Australian venomous spider in real time

sdfasdf 

## Simple mode
Take picture / Scan, it will tell you what kind of spider is it & if it is poisonous  
Even more, you can send the information of that spider to cloud and share with others
## Advanced mode
Amazing features that can deal with multiple spiders
## Spider Gallery
A Gallery showing introduction to different spiders
## Spider Map
A map showing the locations of the spiders shared by others
